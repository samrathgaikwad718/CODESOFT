# CODESOFT

Welcome to **CODESOFT**! This repository contains three Java-based projects that demonstrate fundamental concepts in software development, including object-oriented programming, file handling, and user interaction through console interfaces.

## Projects

### 1. Student Grade Calculator

The **Student Grade Calculator** project allows users to calculate student grades based on their scores. This project demonstrates:
- Input validation
- Conditional logic to determine grades
- Simple user interaction via the console

### 2. ATM Simulation

The **ATM Simulation** project provides a basic simulation of an ATM (Automated Teller Machine). It includes features such as:
- Account balance checking
- Deposit and withdrawal operations
- Transaction history
- User authentication with a PIN
- Error handling for invalid operations

### 3. Student Management System

The **Student Management System** project allows users to manage a collection of student records. This project includes:
- Adding, removing, and searching for students
- Displaying all student records
- Saving and loading student data to and from a file
- Input validation to ensure data integrity
